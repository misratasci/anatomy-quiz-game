# anatomy-quiz-game
 
This is a very modest, simple game I did to also study for anatomy. It consists mostly of questions with and without pictures that ask the muscle's name, insertion points and innervation.

Run main.pyw, choose the body part where you want the questions to come from from the left side, and choose the game "mode" from the right side.
